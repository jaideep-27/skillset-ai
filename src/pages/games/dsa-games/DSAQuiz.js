    question: "Explain how a Binary Search Tree is different from a Binary Tree. Give an example use case for BST.",
    correctAnswer: "A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree with the property that for each node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all elements in the right subtree are greater. Example use case: Implementing a dictionary where quick lookups are needed.",
    points: 20
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "What is the difference between QuickSort and MergeSort? When would you prefer one over the other?",
    correctAnswer: "QuickSort uses a pivot element and partitions the array around it, while MergeSort divides the array into halves and merges them back. QuickSort is generally faster in practice and uses less memory (in-place), but MergeSort is stable and guarantees O(n log n) worst-case time complexity.",
    points: 20
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Describe how a hash table works and explain what collision resolution methods you know.",
    correctAnswer: "A hash table maps keys to values using a hash function. When two keys hash to the same index (collision), it can be resolved using: 1) Chaining - storing collided elements in a linked list, or 2) Open Addressing - finding next empty slot through linear/quadratic probing or double hashing.",
    points: 20
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What is the time complexity of BFS and DFS? Explain a scenario where you would choose BFS over DFS.",
    correctAnswer: "Both BFS and DFS have O(V + E) time complexity where V is vertices and E is edges. BFS is preferred when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, or when exploring nodes level by level, like finding closest friends in a social network.",
    points: 20
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Explain how a min-heap data structure works and its common applications.",
    correctAnswer: "A min-heap is a complete binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its children. It supports O(log n) insertion and deletion, and O(1) access to minimum element. Common applications include priority queues, scheduling algorithms, and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.",
